# crypto

This is an example how to encrypt a string in Javascript with the public key and later decrypt the string in Java with the private key.

We use RSA with OAEP with SHA-1 and with SHA-256

For Javascript the library Web Crypto API is used

In Java standard java.security packages are used

The string is converted to hex
